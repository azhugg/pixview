* Pixview, an image viewer that you can exam pixel values

  Library used are SDL, cairo and GraphicMagick++
* Features[50%]
** DONE browsing all images in the folder
** DONE choose the right window size
** DONE dragging
   When you use ~SDL_blitSurface~, it will alter the ~DestRect~ to make it non
   negative, the simple solution is using ~SrcRect~ instead, the ~srcRect~ can
   go to negative without problem
** DOIN zooming in/out
   This is I guess the most difficult, the main problem is that you need to crop
   part of them image, then scale them. The problem is it is very slow, wait!!!
   Is it true?
   1. find out the part of image to zoom
   2. crop that part
   3. Then on the other hand of your program, you need to update your location
      back to right location
** TODO print pixel value
** TODO Multi-thread
** TODO add foot note, where you can exam pixel value.
